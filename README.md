How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?

When I design software I take a realistically methodical approach that is well documented and ready to be maintained by another developer without prior knowledge. 
I make sure this happens by effectively diagramming systems within the code using various UML techniques and effective pseudocode. Any scripts are also formatted to the standard development methods and practices.
Effective commenting and readable code is a focus when trying to create effective programs and is a central point of my development abilities. 
By clearly defining user requirements and attempting to over communicate with end users the needs of the systwem can theoretically be designed with purpose and effecient methods.
Executing economical but effective testing development in tandem with system development allows for the best end result that minimizes resource waste throughout the total development process.
The key to cost saving test measures is understanding my own weaknesses to exploit any non biased parties abilities in debugging my code effectively without my personal perspective.
A fresh set of eyes always makes for a better product in the long run because of the total perspective approach as opposed to closed idea creation.
Using the testing methods I learned in this course will enable me to create more effective code in my future development projects because of its way of analyzing current systems in real time as they grow.
JUnit was very intuitive and helped my understanding of Java grow.
